# Socket Chat - Live Text Chat üéØ

## Basic Details

### Team Name: SocketPocket

### Team Members

- Ebin John Joseph

### Project Description

A real-time collaborative text chat application that transforms typing into a chaotic, colorful experience. Users can see each other's live typing in random fonts, sizes, and colors across the screen, along with cursor movements and floating text animations.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Who needs boring, predictable text chat when you can have a visual explosion of random fonts and colors? Traditional chat apps are too organized and sensible - we need chaos!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

A web-based chat application where your typing appears in random fonts, sizes, and colors across everyone's screen in real-time. Watch as your words float around like digital confetti while tracking everyone's cursors like a digital surveillance state.
